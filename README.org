#+TITLE: resume

This is the ~LaTeX~ code and pdf for my resume. Read the ~LICENSE~ file
for information about distribution. The template comes from the aptly
named [[https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV][Awesome-CV]]. 

~old-resume.pdf~ contains my resume before migrating to LaTeX, written
in Pages.
